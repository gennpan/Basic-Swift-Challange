# Basic-Swift-Challange
This repo contains a basic challange to study Swift language, but the pupose of the app does not meet the challenge requirements because of it's basic  concept.

----------INFO----------
This application, is a study application so it's purpose is based on the learning of basic swift language. The basic idea was to create an application that could help people in the fight with depression, obviously it is an application far from the real struggle that exists for this pathology, but it is a small contribution that I wanted to give in this field, combined with my learning.
